      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para id="id199571">The chemical industry has been around for a very long time, but not always in the way we think of it today! Dyes, perfumes, medicines and soaps are all examples of products that have been made from chemicals that are found in either plants or animals. However, it was not until the time of the Industrial Revolution that the chemical industry as we know it today began to develop. At the time of the Industrial Revolution, the human population began to grow very quickly and more and more people moved into the cities to live. With this came an increase in the need for things like paper, glass, textiles and soaps. On the farms, there was a greater demand for fertilisers to help produce enough food to feed all the people in cities and rural areas. Chemists and engineers responded to these growing needs by using their technology to produce a variety of new chemicals. This was the start of the chemical industry.</para>
      <para id="id199582">In South Africa, the key event that led to the growth of the chemical industry was the discovery of diamonds and gold in the late 1800's. Mines needed explosives so that they could reach the diamonds and gold-bearing rock, and many of the main chemical companies in South Africa developed to meet this need for explosives. In this chapter, we are going to take a closer look at one of South Africa's major chemical companies, <emphasis effect="bold">Sasol</emphasis>, and will also explore the <emphasis effect="bold">chloralkali</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">fertiliser</emphasis> industries.</para>

      <title>Sasol</title>
      <para id="id199954"><emphasis effect="bold">Oil and natural gas</emphasis> are important fuel resources. Unfortunately, South Africa has no large oil reserves and, until recently, had very little natural gas. One thing South Africa <emphasis effect="italics">does</emphasis> have however, is large supplies of <emphasis effect="bold">coal</emphasis>. Much of South Africa's chemical industry has developed because of the need to produce oil and gas from coal, and this is where Sasol has played a very important role.</para>
      <para id="id199975">Sasol was established in 1950, with its main aim being to convert low grade coal into petroleum (crude oil) products and other chemical feedstocks. A 'feedstock' is something that is used to make another product. Sasol began producing oil from coal in 1955.</para>
<note id="notfhsst_id75"><title> Interesting Fact </title>
      <para id="id199988">The first interest in coal chemistry started as early as the 1920's. In the early 1930's a research engineer called Etienne Rousseau was employed to see whether oil could be made from coal using a new German technology called the <emphasis effect="bold">Fischer-Tropsch</emphasis> process. After a long time, and after many negotiations, Rousseau was given the rights to operate a plant using this new process. As a result, the government-sponsored 'South African Coal, Oil and Gas Corporation Ltd' (commonly called 'Sasol') was formed in 1950 to begin making oil from coal. A manufacturing plant was established in the Free State and the town of <emphasis effect="bold">Sasolburg</emphasis> developed around this plant. Production began in 1955. In 1969, the <emphasis effect="bold">Natref</emphasis> crude oil refinery was established, and by 1980 and 1982 Sasol Two and Sasol Three had been built at <emphasis effect="bold">Secunda</emphasis>.</para>

        <title>Sasol today: Technology and production</title>
        <para id="id200034">Today, Sasol is an oil and gas company with diverse chemical interests. Sasol has three main areas of operation: Firstly, <emphasis effect="bold">coal to liquid fuels technology</emphasis>, secondly the production of <emphasis effect="bold">crude oil</emphasis> and thirdly the conversion of <emphasis effect="bold">natural gas to liquid fuel</emphasis>.</para>

Sasol is involved in mining coal and converting it into synthetic fuels, using the <emphasis effect="bold">Fischer-Tropsch</emphasis> technology. <link target-id="uid3"/> is a simplified diagram of the process that is involved.
<figure id="uid3"><media id="uid3_media" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/CG12C5_001.png" id="uid3_onlineimage" width="877"><!-- NOTE: attribute width changes image size online (pixels). original width is 877. --></image><image mime-type="application/postscript" for="pdf" src="../../media/CG12C5_001.eps" id="uid3_printimage"/></media><caption>The gasification of coal to produce liquid fuels</caption></figure><emphasis effect="bold">Coal gasification</emphasis> is also known as the <emphasis effect="bold">Sasol/Lurgi</emphasis> gasification process, and involves converting low grade coal to a synthesis gas. Low grade coal has a low percentage carbon, and contains other impurities. The coal is put under extremely high pressure and temperature in the presence of steam and oxygen. The gas that is produced has a high concentration of hydrogen (<m:math overflow="scroll"><m:msub><m:mi>H</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub></m:math>) and carbon monoxide (CO). That is why it is called a 'synthesis gas', because it is a mixture of more than one gas.
In the <emphasis effect="bold">Sasol Advanced Synthol (SAS) reactors</emphasis>, the gas undergoes a high temperature Fischer-Tropsch conversion. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide react under high pressure and temperature and in the presence of an iron catalyst, to produce a range of hydrocarbon products. Below is the generalised equation for the process. Don't worry too much about the numbers that you see in front of the reactants and products. It is enough just to see that the reaction of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (the two gases in the <emphasis effect="italics">synthesis gas</emphasis>) produces a hydrocarbon and water.

A range of hydrocarbons are produced, including petrol, diesel, jet fuel, propane, butane, ethylene, polypropylene, alcohols and acetic acids.

</note>You will notice in the diagram that Sasol doesn't only produce liquid fuels, but also a variety of other chemical products. Sometimes it is the synthetic fuels themselves that are used as feedstocks to produce these chemical products. This is done through processes such as <emphasis effect="bold">hydrocracking</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">steamcracking</emphasis>. Cracking is when heavy hydrocarbons are converted to simpler light hydrocarbons (e.g. LPG and petrol) through the breaking of C-C bonds. A heavy hydrocarbon is one that has a high number of hydrogen and carbon atoms (more solid), and a light hydrocarbon has fewer hydrogen and carbon atoms and is either a liquid or a gas.
<definition id="fhsst_id95"><term id="termfhsst_id95"> Hydrocracking </term> <meaning id="meaningfhsst_id95">
Hydrocracking is a cracking process that is assisted by the presence of an elevated partial pressure of hydrogen gas. It produces chemical products such as ethane, LPG, isoparaffins, jet fuel and diesel.
 
</meaning></definition><definition id="fhsst_id99"><term id="termfhsst_id99"> Steam cracking </term> <meaning id="meaningfhsst_id99">
Steam cracking occurs under very high temperatures. During the process, a liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon is diluted with steam and then briefly heated in a furnace at a temperature of about <m:math overflow="scroll"><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mn>850</m:mn><m:mrow><m:mi>c</m:mi><m:mi>i</m:mi><m:mi>r</m:mi><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:mrow></m:msup><m:mi>C</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math>. Steam cracking is used to convert <emphasis effect="italics">ethane</emphasis> to <emphasis effect="italics">ethylene</emphasis>. Ethylene is a chemical that is needed to make plastics. Steam cracking is also used to make propylene, which is an important fuel gas.

          <item id="uid4"><emphasis effect="bold">Production of crude oil</emphasis>
Sasol obtains crude oil off the coast of Gabon (a country in West Africa) and refines this at the Natref refinery (<link target-id="uid5"/>). Sasol also sells liquid fuels through a number of service stations.
<figure id="uid5"><media id="uid5_media" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/CG12C5_002.png" id="uid5_onlineimage" width="732"><!-- NOTE: attribute width changes image size online (pixels). original width is 732. --></image><image mime-type="application/postscript" for="pdf" src="../../media/CG12C5_002.eps" id="uid5_printimage"/></media><caption>Crude oil is refined at Sasol's Natref refinery to produce liquid fuels</caption></figure></item>
          <item id="uid6"><emphasis effect="bold">Liquid fuels from natural gas</emphasis>
Sasol produces natural gas in Mozambique and is expanding its 'gas to fuel' technology. The gas undergoes a complex process to produce linear-chained hydrocarbons such as waxes and paraffins (<link target-id="uid7"/>).
<figure id="uid7"><media id="uid7_media" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/CG12C5_003.png" id="uid7_onlineimage" width="786"><!-- NOTE: attribute width changes image size online (pixels). original width is 786. --></image><image mime-type="application/postscript" for="pdf" src="../../media/CG12C5_003.eps" id="uid7_printimage"/></media><caption>Conversion of natural gas to liquid fuels</caption></figure>
In the <emphasis effect="bold">autothermal reactor</emphasis>, methane from natural gas reacts with steam and oxygen over an iron-based catalyst to produce a <emphasis effect="italics">synthesis gas</emphasis>. This is a similar process to that involved in coal gasification. The oxygen is produced through the <emphasis effect="bold">fractional distillation of air</emphasis>.
<definition id="fhsst_id111"><term id="termfhsst_id111"> Fractional distillation </term> <meaning id="meaningfhsst_id111">
Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions. Since air is made up of a number of gases (with the major component being nitrogen), fractional distillation can be used to separate it into these different parts.
 
</meaning></definition>The syngas is then passes through a <emphasis effect="bold">Sasol Slurry Phase Distillate (SSPD)</emphasis> process. In this process, the gas is reacted at far lower temperatures than in the SAS reactors. Apart from hard wax and candle wax, high quality diesel can also be produced in this process. Residual gas from the SSPD process is sold as pipeline gas while some of the lighter hydrocarbons are treated to produce kerosene and paraffin. Ammonia is also produced, which can be used to make fertilisers.

Sasol failed to identify hazards associated with a high-pressure gas pipeline running through the plant, which had been shut for extensive maintenance work, in the presence of hundreds of people and numerous machines, including cranes, fitters, contractors, and welding and cutting machines. Because there had never been a risk assessment, the hazard of the high-pressure pipeline had never been identified.</quote>

        <para id="id202455">Sasol is very aware of its responsibility towards creating cleaner fuels. From 1st January 2006, the South African government enforced a law to prevent lead from being added to petrol. Sasol has complied with this. One branch of Sasol, <emphasis effect="bold">Sasol Technology</emphasis> also has a bio-diesel research and development programme focused on developing more environmentally friendly forms of diesel. One way to do this is to use renewable resources such as soybeans to make diesel. Sasol is busy investigating this new technology.</para>
